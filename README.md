# Spring Salesforce
Spring Salesforce is a Spring extension that provides connection support and API binding for Salesforce
REST API.

## Usage
The library can leverage Spring Security or implement the OAuth2 flow independently of it.

There is a Spring Boot Example app available at https://github.com/jottley/spring-salesforce-quickstart

It gives examples of both use cases.

## Maven

```xml

## Historical Notes
The project maintains part of the package naming for historical reasons. It should be thought of as deprecated and will eventually be removed. It is not associated with Spring beyond that; it leverages libraries from Spring and is intended to be used by projects that use the Spring framework.
